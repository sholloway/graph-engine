# I think this should be redesigned. Using endpoints as verbs feels wrong.
# The endpoints should be nouns that have actions applied to them via the HTTP
# methods when possible. Perhaps the resouce for login/logout is "Session".
# e.g /session?action=login /session?action=logout or POST /session DELETE /session
